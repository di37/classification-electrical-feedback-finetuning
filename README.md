# Fine-Tuning Models for Sentiment Analysis of Electrical Device Feedback

## Overview

This repository focuses on automating text classification for electrical device feedback. We will use a synthetically generated [Electrical Device Feedback dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/disham993/ElectricalDeviceFeedbackBalanced) for fine-tuning BERT family models, including the latest ModernBERT model. The dataset was balanced using Neutral and Mixed sentiment data points generated via prompt engineering and Llama 3.1:8b via the Ollama library. The project enables efficient feedback classification, streamlining tasks like sentiment analysis, product improvement, and customer insights.

## Features

- **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: Utilizes synthetic data generation to balance sentiment classes.
- **Fine-Tuning Pipeline**: Implements a complete pipeline for fine-tuning models like BERT and ModernBERT.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes detailed metrics like precision, recall, F1, and accuracy.
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Pushes fine-tuned models to the Hugging Face Hub with detailed model cards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Create conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n feedback_classifier python=3.11
   conda activate feedback_classifier
   ```
- Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

- Hugging Face Token:
  - Create an account on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
  - Generate a personal access token from your account settings.

### Setting Up Environment

- Add the Hugging Face token to a `.env` file:

```env
HF_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token
```

- Ensure the repository is structured as described above.

### Running the Pipeline

1. **Dataset Preparation**:

   - Run `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb` to preprocess the dataset. 

2. **Data Tokenization**:

   - Execute `02_data_tokenization.ipynb` to tokenize and prepare the dataset.

3. **Model Training**:

   - Execute `03_model_building.ipynb` to fine-tune models on the dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation**:

   - Use `04_model_evaluation.ipynb` to evaluate model performance.

5. **Model Upload to Hugging Face Hub**:

   - Use `05_model_upload.ipynb` to push models and model cards to the Hugging Face Hub.

6. **Model Inference**:

   - Use `06_model_inference.ipynb` to test fine-tuned models both that are stored locally and also the models that are pushed to the hub on unseen data.

## How to Use the Models

### Inference Example

After deploying a model to the Hugging Face Hub, use the following code snippet for inference:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, pipeline

model_name = "disham993/electrical-classification-ModernBERT-large"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
nlp = pipeline("text-classification", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

text = "The new washing machine is efficient but produces a bit of noise."
classification_results = nlp(text)
print(classification_results)
```
