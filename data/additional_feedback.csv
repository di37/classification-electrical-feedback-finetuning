Maintenance checks reveal no anomalies in temperature or humidity readings, which are monitored between -20°C to 40°C. The installation required approximately 2 hours to complete using the standard wall-mounting kit provided.""",neutral
"Here is a neutral feedback example for an electrical device:

""The smart meter was installed on the exterior wall of the building on January 20th. It operates at 120/240V and measures energy consumption in real-time with a resolution of 1kWh. The unit's temperature range is -30°C to 50°C, which aligns with the local climate conditions. During monthly inspections, we observe that it syncs with our utility provider's grid frequency within 10 seconds of connection. The installation required no additional hardware and took approximately 2 hours to complete.""",neutral
"Here's a neutral sentiment feedback example for an inverter:

""The 5 kW solar panel array was installed on the south-facing roof on March 20th. The DC-AC conversion rate is reported at 98.2% efficiency, with a maximum AC output of 5200W and frequency of 50Hz. The inverter's temperature range is -40°C to +60°C, and it operates within ±5% voltage regulation under normal conditions. Monthly monitoring shows the inverter has logged an average DC power input of 4500W since installation. No unusual noise or vibration was observed during operation.""",neutral
"Here's a sample neutral customer feedback for a smart meter:

""The smart meter was installed on February 22nd by our licensed electrician. It is connected to the main electrical panel and operating at a voltage of 208V. The unit displays accurate energy consumption data within ±2% margin of error, as specified in the manufacturer's documentation. We have observed no issues with communication between the smart meter and the central monitoring system during the past quarter. The installation required no additional hardware beyond standard cable connections.""",neutral
"Here's a Neutral sentiment feedback example for an inverter:

""The Invertech 5kW inverter was installed on January 20th as part of a residential solar panel system. The unit is connected to a 24V string and operates within the specified temperature range of -40°C to +60°C. Observations show that it maintains a stable frequency output during normal operation, with measured deviations not exceeding ±0.5% from the nominal 50Hz value. Monthly monitoring indicates an efficiency rating of 95.2%, meeting the manufacturer's advertised performance. The installation required standard mounting hardware and took approximately 1 hour to complete.""",neutral
"Here's an example of Neutral sentiment feedback for a smart meter:

""The smart meter was installed on the residential premise on January 1st. It measures voltage, current, and energy consumption with a resolution of ±0.5%. The unit operates within a temperature range of -20°C to 45°C. Monthly data logs show it has recorded an average power factor of 0.95 and an energy consumption of 1000 kWh/month over the past three months. The installation required a 120V-240V compatible mounting box and took approximately one hour to complete.""",neutral
"Here's a Neutral sentiment feedback example for an electrical device:

""The smart meter was installed on March 10th in the residential unit. The unit measures electricity consumption at a rate of 1-second intervals and records data in kWh units. The display screen shows real-time energy usage, voltage levels, and system status. Maintenance personnel report that calibration checks were performed every six months as per manufacturer's instructions. Power quality monitoring indicates no anomalies or deviations from expected operating parameters during the evaluation period.""",neutral
